Discounted Cash Flow

## Introduction
DCF, in short, applies a discounted rate (a temporal rate that accounts for rate of return in the future) to projected future cash flows. By applying the discount rate, the analysis effectively discounts the future values back to the present value, arriving at the terminal value. Lastly, the sum of the terminal values leads to the enterprise value, which can be adjusted accordingly to the firm. This equity value gets compared to the current market value to determine undervaluation or overvaluation. This code allows you to easily calculate the WACC rate for any company. 

## WACC
Initialize the github repo on your local computer and setup a venv/conda environment. Run the notebook and update the fundamental data on the last couples of lines and you will get your WACC rate.
